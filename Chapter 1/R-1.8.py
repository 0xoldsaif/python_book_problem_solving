'''
Python allows negative integers to be used as indices into a sequence,
such as a string. If string s has length n, and expression s[k] is used for index
−n ≤ k < 0, what is the equivalent index j ≥ 0 such that s[j] references
the same element?

# s = 'mohamed'
# n = len(s)
# for j in range(0,(len(s)+1)):
#     for k in range(-n,0):
#         # print(j ,k )
#         if s[j-n] == s[k]: # this is my SOLUTION
#             print('YES')
